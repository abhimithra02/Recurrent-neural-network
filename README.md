Sentiment Analysis on Movie Review Using Deep Learning RNN Method


The usage of social media grows rapidly because of the functionality like easy to use and it will also allow user to connect with all around the globe to share the ideas. It is desired to automatically use the information which is userâ€™s interest. One of the meaningful information that is derived from the social media sites are sentiments. Sentiment analysis is used for finding relevant documents, overall sentiment, and relevant sections; quantifying the sentiment; and aggregating all sentiments to form an overview. Sentiment analysis for movie review classification is useful to analyze the information in the form of number of reviews where opinions are either positive or negative. In this paper we had applied the deep learning-based classification algorithm RNN, measured the performance of the classifier based on the pre-process of data, and obtained 94.61% accuracy. Here we had used RNN algorithm instead of machine learning algorithm because machine learning algorithm works only in single layer while RNN algorithm works on multilayer that gives you better output as compared to machine learning.
